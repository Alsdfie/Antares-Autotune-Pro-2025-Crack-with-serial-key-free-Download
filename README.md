This is especially useful for users who want to fine-tune specific notes or phrases in a performance Flex-Tune is a feature that provides a more transparent and natural pitch correction. It allows for some slight variation in pitch to keep the vocal performance sounding more organic, instead of forcing every note to a perfect pitch In addition to its standard pitch correction, Auto-Tune can be used for pitch shifting to create musical effects. This is useful for creating harmonies, background vocals, or other creative vocal effects that need to be shifted in pitch without changing the original performance.
